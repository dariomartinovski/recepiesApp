# Recepies App.
This project was created using reactJS. It was mainly a practice for testing api calls, but turned into a real project. \
I used few react libraries, like splideJS for the carousells, react router dom for the navigation links and for params. \
I used fetch for the api calls, fetching data from spoonacular api and from the cocktailDB api accordingly.
